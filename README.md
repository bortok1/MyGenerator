## My Generator

### About project
Creates map of square tiles with roads connecting special places.

Basic terrain of tiles of 4 main types (desert, forest, grass and river) is generated using Perlin noise. Special places are randomly placed on that map, and connected by roads generated by A* algorythm.

All tiles are animated except road tiles, as long as camera is close enough and tile is in view of camera.
